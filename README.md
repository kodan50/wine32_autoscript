# wine32_autoscript
Helps to automate running apps in wine32 without a lot of complicated script edits and such

 I read somewhere that switching between a 64-bit and 32-bit flavor of Wine is annoying and you have to use scripts everywhere and whatever. I don't like this solution, so if you need a simpler way to handle a 32-bit and a 64-bit version of Wine, this script will allow you to call a 32-bit flavor right away. In theory, you should be able to use this for any version of Wine that isn't your main. I also have no idea what I am doing, so I won't be held liable if this wipes your computer. Have fun!
